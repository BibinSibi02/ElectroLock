Raspberry Pi design

The Raspberry Pi 4 Model B is held in a black metal casing that protects the internal circuitry. A microSD card with 128GB of storage was used for the Pi, however a large majority of that went unused. Without the app, the script on the pi that handles locks and unlocks can be run manually and utilized with a key press to control the lock. In this case, a usb keyboard is required.
